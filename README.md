# AwSim
AwSim for CCTA version 2

Instructions:  Make a local directory for AwSim
(C:\AwSim for example.) Be sure this location
is not subject to the Windows settings for
Controlled Folder Access. If it is, AwSim will
be unable to save its own config file there.
If you use a third party seurity program it
may need to be instructed to allow AwSim to
run (including the supporting .exe files found
in the same directory.)

Download and unzip AwSim.zip.

Highly recommended:
Make a shortcut to AwSim.cmd and pin it to
your task bar. For Windows 11 the way to
do this is a little tricky so follow carefully:

1. In File Explorer, find and right click on AwSim.cmd.
2. Under Show more options choose Send to...Desktop (create shortcut.)

Then look for the AwSim shortcut on your desktop.

3. Right click it and choose Properties.
4. Change the icon by browsing for the one in the AwSim directory.
5. Then, while still in Properties, edit the field called Target
by inserting 'explorer ' (without quotes but with a space after it)
at the beginning if the line, before 'C:\...AwSim'. Then save it.
6. Now right click it again and choose Show more options Pin to taskbar.
7. Before you can run it, right click the AwSim icon on your taskbar and 
select Properties. Once again edit the entry for Target but this time 
remove 'C:\path\explorer.exe'.

Bingo! You can now run AwSim from a taskbar icon.
The first time you run AwSim it will start setup. It should be
self-explanatory from there. If I missed anything, let me know.
